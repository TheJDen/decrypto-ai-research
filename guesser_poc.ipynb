    "A useful abstraction is thinking of each of the opponent's keywords as a random variable. We know the opponent has a keyword card with a certain number of fixed keywords, but not what the keywords are. However, we know they must be *a* word. So we may as well think of each of their words as having some probability of being each word possible, and refine the probability values based on context and revealed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat less obvious is that we may do the same for our own keywords; for each word, the distribution would simply have probability 1 for the keyword, and 0 for every other word."

    "To make a good guess, the objective would be to maximize the probability of our guess; this gives the highest likelihood of being correct and raises our expected score through interceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have keywords [\"GARDEN\", \"MUSKET\", \"BOWL\", \"BAT\"] and clues (\"wing\", \"leaf\", \"powder\"). We might notice right away that \"wing\" makes a lot of sense with \"BAT\", so we might choose the first code number to be index 3 and remove both from consideration. This simplifies our consideration to [\"GARDEN\", \"MUSKET\", \"BOWL\"] and clues (\"leaf\", \"powder\"), where we might identify more easily now that \"leaf\" corresponds to \"GARDEN\". Again, we might choose 0 as our next code number and remove both from consideration. This yields [\"MUSKET\", \"BOWL\"] and clues (\"powder\"). It is much easier to identify that \"powder\" probably corresponds to \"MUSKET\". We notice that guessing has somewhat of a recursive property. \n",

    "For clarity I should note that although I went over probabilities here, that only makes sense for a single keyword, which is what the Guesser deals with. To make this more general, when we deal with each keyword as a random variable, we should think about the *expected* probability.\n",

    "We might be able to optimize with Dynamic Programming but let's worry about that later if it proves necessary.\n",
    "I am going to use log probabilities becasue some of the probabilities we are working with might get very small, and it will help preserve precision. Additionally, adding and subtracting might yield us some speed benefits. This should also help in the future should we explore this more in the information theory context.\n",
