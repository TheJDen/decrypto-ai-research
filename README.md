## decrypto-ai-research
Research Decrypto strategies with different AI agents. This repository is an exercise in the game-ification of AI research. Let's see how thinking about Decrypto can guide idea generation.

## decryptoai

decryptoai is a package that keeps track of my algorithm implementations. It is not deployed to PyPi because the algorithms are still experimental. It may be installed by cloning the repo and pip installing decryptoai in the same directory.

# notebooks/word2vec/word2vec_integration
First look at how word2vec embeddings behave in the Decrypto context

# notebooks/datamuse
Use the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) and asyncio to generate synthetic datasets

# notebooks/proof-of-concept
Demonstrate original approach to interpretable Decrypto Guessing and Intercepting agents

# notebooks/word2vec
Use word2vec embeddings to create heuristics that make our POC prototypes competent

# notebooks/word2vec/word2vec_supervised_guesser.ipynb
Explore more traditional approach to Guesser using neural nets. Has demoonstrated that game-ification may inspire attention-based architecture!

# notebooks/alternative_guessers.ipynb
Other guessing algorithms I considered that used COmpetitive Programming techniques like Recursive Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, and enumerating bitsets
