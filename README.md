## decrypto-ai-research
Research Decrypto strategies with different AI agents. This repository is an exercise in the game-ification of AI research. Let's see how thinking about Decrypto can guide idea generation.

# word2vec integration
First look at how word2vec embeddings behave in the Decrypto context

# synthetic datamuse
Use the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) and asyncio to generate synthetic datasets

# unsupervised guesser proof-of-concept
Demonstrate original approach to interpretable Decrypto Guessing agent

# word2vec unsupervised guessing
Use word2vec embeddings to create heuristics that make our unsupervised guesser prototype competent

# word2vec supervised guessing
Explore more traditional approach to Guesser using neural nets. May lead to proof that game-ification may inspire attention-based architecture.
